## Covid19 Data Exploration and Data Cleaning Of Housing Data

### Covid19 Data Exploration
**Data Source**
- The data used for this exploration analysis was obtained from  [Covid19 Deaths](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx)
  and [Covid19 Vaccinations](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidVaccinations.xlsx) . 
- Two tables were used for this analysis, namely CovidDeaths,CovidVaccinations
- The tables were imported as excel files into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for analysis

  **Analysis**
  From CovidDeaths table,I looked at:
  - Probability of dying from Covid
  - Percentage of population to contract Covid
  - Countries with high number of infections against population
  - Countries with high number of deaths against population
  - Continents with high death counts
  - Total death count
 
    From COvidVaccinations table,
    - Vaccinations against total population
